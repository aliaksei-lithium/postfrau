# Decision log

ADR-style entries, newest last. Every deviation from `PLAN.md` gets one, and `PLAN.md` is edited to
match so the plan stays truthful.

## D1 — Hand-written `Postfrau.icon` bundle instead of Icon Composer

**Phase 0.** Icon Composer is a GUI app and cannot be driven headlessly, so the placeholder icon is a
hand-written `.icon` bundle: `icon.json` (linear gradient fill, one image layer, neutral shadow,
translucency) plus `Assets/glyph.png` rendered once by a CoreGraphics script. `xcrun actool` compiles
it to `Postfrau.icns` + `Assets.car` without complaint, which confirms the format. The final icon in
Phase 11 can be authored in Icon Composer and dropped in at the same path.

## D2 — `SWIFT_VERSION = 6.0`, not `6`

**Phase 0.** `project.yml` sets `SWIFT_VERSION: "6.0"`. Xcode's build setting takes a language-mode
version (`5.0` / `6.0`), not a compiler version; `PLAN.md` §6 Phase 0 said `SWIFT_VERSION=6`, which is
the same thing but written in a form Xcode normalizes anyway. Recorded so the discrepancy with the
plan text isn't mistaken for a mistake later.

## D3 — Hardened runtime off in the project, on only in `release.sh`

**Phase 0.** With `ENABLE_HARDENED_RUNTIME = YES` in the shared build settings, `xcodebuild test`
failed: the ad-hoc-signed `PostfrauUITests-Runner.app` refused to `dlopen` the equally ad-hoc-signed
`PostfrauUITests.xctest` ("mapping process and mapped file (non-platform) have different Team IDs").
That is hardened-runtime library validation, which cannot be satisfied by two independent ad-hoc
signatures and there is no Developer ID on this machine. The runtime is therefore off in `project.yml`
and turned on by `Scripts/release.sh` for the Release archive, where it actually matters
(notarization). If a Developer ID is ever configured, the setting can move back into `project.yml`.

## D4 — UI-test target keeps `nonisolated` default actor isolation

**Phase 0.** `SWIFT_DEFAULT_ACTOR_ISOLATION = MainActor` makes an `XCTestCase` subclass main-actor
isolated, which conflicts with the `nonisolated` `init(invocation:)` / `init(selector:)` it overrides.
`PostfrauUITests` therefore builds `nonisolated` by default (XCTest's own model); the app and
`PostfrauTests` (Swift Testing, no base class) stay main-actor by default as `PLAN.md` §0 specifies.

## D5 — Model type names that avoid collisions: `RequestCollection`, `RequestEnvironment`, `RequestBody`, `CollectionItem`

**Phase 1.** `PLAN.md` §3 names four types `Collection`, `Environment`, `Body` and `Item`. Each
would shadow something the code needs:

| Plan name | Collides with | Consequence |
|---|---|---|
| `Collection` | `Swift.Collection` | any `where C: Collection` inside PostfrauCore stops compiling |
| `Environment` | `SwiftUI.Environment` | `@Environment(\.foo)` becomes ambiguous in every view that imports both |
| `Body` | `View.Body` associated type | `Body.none` inside a `View` resolves to the view's own `Body` |
| `Item` | far too generic | unhelpful in the app layer's namespace |

They are therefore `RequestCollection`, `RequestEnvironment`, `RequestBody` and `CollectionItem`.
`PLAN.md` §3 has been updated to match. Everything else keeps its planned name.

## D6 — `CryptoKit` in Core for SHA-256

**Phase 1.** `PLAN.md` §7 rule 1 says Core imports only Foundation and Security. Own-write
fingerprinting (§4) needs a content digest, and Security exposes no convenient hashing API.
`CryptoKit` is a system framework with no dependency cost, so `AtomicFile` imports it rather than
hand-rolling SHA-256 or reaching for CommonCrypto's deprecated C API. Rule 1 in `PLAN.md` now
reads "Foundation, Security and CryptoKit".

## D7 — ISO-8601 timestamps with fractional seconds

**Phase 1.** Plain `.iso8601` truncates to whole seconds, so a document did not round-trip to an
equal model and equality-based tests were meaningless. The shared coders use
`Date.ISO8601FormatStyle(includingFractionalSeconds: true)` for writing and accept both forms when
reading. Millisecond precision is enough for `createdAt` / `updatedAt`; tests that compare whole
models use timestamps that are exact at that precision.

## D8 — `Keychain.deleteAll` loops `SecItemDelete`

**Phase 1.** On macOS's file-based keychain a service-wide `SecItemDelete` removes exactly **one**
matching item and returns `errSecSuccess`, and the call rejects `kSecMatchLimit`. Verified with a
standalone probe: adding two items and deleting service-wide left one behind. `deleteAll` therefore
repeats the delete until `errSecItemNotFound`, bounded so it can never spin forever.
